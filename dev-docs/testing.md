# Testing

The project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing.
Automated visual testing is done with [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/)
Manual testing is done with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and the dev site created by the CI on every commit.

For future consideration, it is recommended to improve the test coverage of the components by adding automated tests in Storybook and by using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing.
