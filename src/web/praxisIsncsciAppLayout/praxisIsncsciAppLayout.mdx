# Praxis ISNCSCI App Layout

## Design Problem

We need a layout for the contents with the following sections:

- Application bar which will contain the menu button, optional app title, and optional action buttons
- Input section which will contain the input controls, grids, and diagram
- Classification section which may be docked at the bottom or presented as a modal

## Approach

Favoring composition, we use slots for the different sections.
We use a flex layout to position the different sections.

### Slots

- `app-bar` - Expects a `praxis-isncsci-app-bar` element
- `input-layout` - Expects a `praxis-isncsci-input-layout` element
- `classification` - Expects a `praxis-isncsci-classification` element

## Attributes

`classification-style`: Used to determine the visibility and position of the classification section.
When the attribute is not present, the classification section is hidden.
When set to `visible`, the classification section is fixed at the bottom above the input section.
The css variable `--calc-classification-height` is used to set the bottom padding in the input section to the height of the classification section so that all inputs can be visible after scrolling.
When set to `static`, the classification section is positioned below the input section.
