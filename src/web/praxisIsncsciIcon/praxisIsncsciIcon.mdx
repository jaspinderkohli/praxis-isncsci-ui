# Praxis ISNCSCI Icon

## Problem

- We need an icon component that can receive a name, theme, and size and render the appropriate SVG icon graphic
- The element needs to be implemented in a way that only the referenced icons end up as part of the code bundle
- The close icon is the first icon we need to support as it is needed for the classification dialog

## Solution

We created individual custom elements, with SVG icons as their shadow DOM, that can be referenced by name and theme using the `<praxis-isncsci-icon />` component.

Example:

```html
<praxis-isncsci-icon component="regular-close-24" />
```

### Icons

<Canvas of={Stories.Primary} />
