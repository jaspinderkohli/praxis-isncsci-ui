# Praxis ISNCSCI Icon

## Problem

- We need an icon component that can receive a name, theme, and size and render the appropriate SVG icon graphic
- It should allow us to switch between icon sets, as they may needed by different themes

## Solution

We are using SVG _sprites_. All of our icons are in a single SVG file.
The `<praxis-isncsci-icon />` loads the sprites using the `<use>` tag.
One donwside of the approach is that we do not add the needed icons to the bundle, but it gives us more flexibility with our caching.
This approach also makes it possible for us to switch from one icon collection to another when a theme requires it.
The supported icon sizes are: `12`, `16`, `20`, `24`, `32`, and `48`.

Example:

```html
<praxis-isncsci-icon href="/icons/regular.svg#icon-close-24" size="24" />
```
