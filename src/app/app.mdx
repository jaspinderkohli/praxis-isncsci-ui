# Praxis ISNCSCI App

## Design Problem

We need a component that will manage the business logic and user interaction and will call the appropriate use cases to update the state of the application.

## Approach

The web app component adds the needed event listeners and controllers to manage user interaction.
It exposes the `initialize` method where different implementations can pass in their own providers.

## Public methods

### initialize

```js
public initialize(
  appStore: IDataStore<IAppState>,
  appStoreProvider: IIsncsciAppStoreProvider,
): void
```

## Primary

<Canvas of={Stories.Primary} />
