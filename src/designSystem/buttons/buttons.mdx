# Button styles

## Design Problem

We want to have custom looking buttons in our application.
We did not want to have a button web component as, like all other input elements, buttons have significant native functionality that we do not want to replicate.
The solution needs also to be applicable to links as it is common to style links as buttons.

## Approach

CSS styles to customize the appearance of buttons and links.
We are using class names, as opposed of targetting elements directly, to allow us to choose which elements to style.

## .button

- Adds a surface to the element

<Canvas of={Stories.Button} />

## .icon-button

- Aligns the icon to the center of the button and ensures it is of fixed size.

<Canvas of={Stories.IconButton} />
